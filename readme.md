# Snail jumper

(SnailJumper.png)

The game is so simple! a runner agent needs to jump over obstacles to survive. 
This game has two modes: 
1) Manual mode which you should use "space bar" to jump over obstacles.
2) Neuroevoloution mode which is the final goal of this project :) . In this mode a generation of 300 agents is produced at the beginning. In the next generations, you'll see that agents act better because of evolution!

The goal of this project is to implement an accurate neuroevolution algorithm, so agents get better in each new generation.
